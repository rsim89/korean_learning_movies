now. How did you pass through that door, anyway?

1265
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:07,620
Oh, was it Paju? The
English village there?

1266
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,373
(Eun Tak) Ugh, but even if
it was there, it's still strange.

1267
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:13,585
What the heck is going
on? Where exactly are we?

1268
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:14,794
Canada?

1269
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,129
Is it Canada?

1270
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,340
(Eun Tak) If it's Canada...

1271
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:22,802
That, the land of maple leaves?

1272
01:26:23,136 --> 01:26:24,470
The one with the auroras?

1273
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,890
(Euntak)
Is this really a foreign country?

1274
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:37,775
Wow, Uncle, you had this ability too?

1275
01:26:38,401 --> 01:26:40,987
You have it too, what are you really?

1276
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:45,742
(Euntak)
This is really Canada and
if Uncle's abilities are like this

1277
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,160
I’ve made up my mind

1278
01:26:49,078 --> 01:26:50,747
- What?
- I’ve decided, I

1279

(Kim Shin)
What, what?

1280
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:53,416
I'm going to get married, to you, Uncle

1281
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:56,794
(Euntak)
No matter how much I think about it
I really think you are a goblin

1282
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:58,922
[smiling slightly]
I love you

(Euntak)
Is this it? A red carpet for me?

1285
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:53,351
It’s an honor to walk together, right?

1286
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,105
(Kim Shin)
What on earth are you talking about?

1287
01:27:57,188 --> 01:27:59,774
(Euntak)
I’m going to be your bride 200 years later

1288
01:28:01,901 --> 01:28:03,528
(Kim Shin)
It seems like you'll keep calling me

1289
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:06,114
I want to appear intelligent and flawless anywhere, anytime

1290
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:07,657
Did I seem manly?

Be careful of the man with the hat, the black hat.

(Euntak)
Am I going to die?
I'm only just nineteen?

1295
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:20,378
I died at nine and I died at ten

1296
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,966
That's death
