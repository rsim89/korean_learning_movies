- Yes

Would you like that?

Then I'll naturally

01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,453
say 'Do you want to eat beef?'

966
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,456
I'll quickly put on my coat

So why is it that I have to go overseas at this age of nine?

981
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,981
I didn’t even go to the supermarket in front of my house when I was twenty-nine.

Still, I don't look like a person who just came to a foreign country.
I'm getting around really well.
