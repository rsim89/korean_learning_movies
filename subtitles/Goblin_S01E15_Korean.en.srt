As I was thinking about Canada
Kim Shin's thoughts naturally came to mind

962
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,077
I went to see my first love four times

963

I fed my first love a cow

964
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,249
My first love said she was still pretty

965
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,001
But?

966
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:53,006
So I thought that first love might not be me

967
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,507
[smirking]
But?

968

Then what about that first love they say was met during the late Joseon Dynasty under Cheoljong?

Even before we met
That time I didn't even know

01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,942
You stayed for a while and left

974
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,654
I saw you in the winter of the 12th year of Cheoljong

That all those first loves were me

982
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,135

That appearance

01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,184
Is it possibly the appearance of the god Mu-shin Kim-shin?

Yeah
