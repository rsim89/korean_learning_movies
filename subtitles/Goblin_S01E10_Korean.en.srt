01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:41,946
Chairman Yoo asked about you

1114
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,075
He said to ask how your friend who's visiting is doing

1115
01:10:48,535 --> 01:10:50,621
He must be asking while knowing everything, right?

1116
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,915
What, did you get dumped?

(Kim Shin)
Have you tried contacting her?

1119
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:57,962
I couldn't

1120
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,713
If I do this time

1121
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:02,716
I really have to come out and say what I am

1122
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,469
The way you look
is definitely that of a grim reaper, what

1123
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,221
Isn't that woman a bit slow?

1124
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,270
Is that all?

1125
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,689
- (Kim Shin) What?
- The feelings I get from Sunny

1126
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:18,774
There's more

1127
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,234
Is there?

1128
01:11:20,317 --> 01:11:22,903
That woman
I felt had an undeserved name

1129
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,738
To have the same name as my sister

1130
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,198
Good thing we broke up

1131
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:29,368
Every time I saw you, there
was nothing about you that I liked.

1132
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,997
And if you listen quietly,
there is no logic at all.

1133
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,001
Ms. Sunny is being cursed.

1134
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,044
I think I should stop.

1135
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,421
Oh, it's comforting?

1136
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:44,216
(The Grim Reaper) There's
something I haven't told you.

1137
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,093
It's about what Sunny
saw in her past life.

1138
01:11:46,885 --> 01:11:48,595
- You said it's a secret?
- (Grim Reaper) Sunny.

1139
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,390
It seems like your younger
sister has been reincarnated.

1140
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:52,933
Is it you, Sunny? Not you?

1141
01:11:53,017 --> 01:11:54,852
Sunny's face in her past life

1142
01:11:56,562 --> 01:12:00,024
The face of the woman
in the scroll you have

1143
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,405
It was the same.

1144
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:10,743
Are you sure?

1145
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:13,704
What did you see?

1146
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,956
(The Grim Reaper)
The woman I saw was

1147
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:19,626
I'm standing in the
middle of the palace.

1148
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:24,506
(The Grim Reaper) Wearing
white clothes and looking dignified.

1149
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,260
I was hit by an
arrow in the chest.

1150
01:12:30,637 --> 01:12:32,681
I collapsed, bleeding.

1151
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,272
I told you that.

1152
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,316
Even if it wasn't white clothing

1153
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:46,820
I feel like I didn't even
talk about the bow.

1154
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,740
(Kim Shin) Is there anything else?
Haven't you seen anything more?

1155
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:54,661
I rode in a carriage and
smiled while looking at someone.

1156
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:55,996
Through the small window

1157
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,332
(The Grim Reaper)
Asked with a smile

1158
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:00,751
I'm today...

1159
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,211
(Kim Sun) Am I pretty today?

1160
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,341
(The Grim Reaper)
Answering her question

1161
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,760
There was a voice.

1162
01:13:10,469 --> 01:13:11,845
- 'Ugly...' 
- (Kim Shin) It's ugly.
