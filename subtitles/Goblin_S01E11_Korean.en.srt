01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:52,206
but they were a spirit with no information at all.

1121
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,540
What kind of spirit was it?

1122
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,337
It seemed like they had wandered in this world for a very long time,

1123
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,006
and they didn't seem to be afraid at all.

1124
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,219
It was strange to see a spirit that wasn't afraid of the reaper.

Of course, I missed it.

01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,808
I just submitted the paperwork for no reason and got the short end of the stick.

1127
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:13,686
The remaining sheet is for that spirit.

It's a new face.

about the experience that has been wandering for ages.

Ah, that...

(Ghost 2)
They say that 20 years ago,

1132
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,740
they once met a reaper and ran away.

1133
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:28,242
Really?

1134
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:29,910
I also had a similar experience when I was nine...

Did you give the answer

or did you ask the question
